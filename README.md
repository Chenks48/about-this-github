## 🟦 Threat Modeling Technician — Blue Team Cybersecurity

Some repositories have constant activity…  
this one has **intentional activity**.

I work as a **Threat Modeling Technician** on the **Blue Team**, analyzing threats, modeling unlikely scenarios (until they happen), and breaking systems *on paper* so real attackers don’t get the chance.

---

## 🧠 What I actually do

- Identify threats before they become incidents  
- Design attack models no one asked for, but everyone needs  
- Create and tune detection rules across different SIEMs   
- Think like an attacker, act like a defender  

---

## 😴 About this GitHub’s activity

My upload schedule is **organic and natural**, just like Snorlax:

> 💤 When Snorlax is asleep, this GitHub sleeps too.  
> ⚡ When Snorlax wakes up… commits suddenly appear.

I don’t upload often, but when I do:
- I learned something new  
- I create something interesting  
- Or Snorlax decided it was time

## 📂 What you’ll find here (when I’m awake)

- Threat modeling notes  
- Detection rules for different SIEMs  
- Defensive proof-of-concepts and simulations  
- Things that *probably* shouldn’t exist, but do  

---

## 🧰 Tech & concepts

- Threat Modeling (MITRE ATT&CK)
- Risk analysis  
- Blue Team operations  
- Defensive security  
- Detection engineering across multiple SIEMs (Sentinel, Elastic, QRadar, Cortex, Splunk, CrowdStrike, Defender)  
- A lot of coffee ☕  

---

## 📅 Current status

- 🔵 Defending systems  
- 🟡 Learning new things (always)  
- 🔴 Probably sleeping

## ⚠️ Important note

This repository does **not** represent constant activity —  
it represents **deliberate activity**.

Security never sleeps…  
I do.

## 💤 Fun fact

Snorlax isn’t lazy.  
It’s **energy efficient**.  
So am I.
